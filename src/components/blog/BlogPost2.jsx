 intro:"Software teams release faster than ever, and testing has to keep up. Artificial intelligence is now part of that story, helping testers write, run and maintain tests with less manual effort. This guide explains what AI changes in software testing, where it falls short and which skills to build, whether you are a fresher or a manual tester planning a move into automation.",
 sections:[
 {id:"why-traditional",h:"Why traditional test automation struggles",p:["Classic automation relies on fixed locators such as IDs and XPath.

 {id:"limits",h:"Limits and risks of AI in testing",p:["AI is useful, not magic. Generated tests can be wrong or redundant, so a person must review them.

 {id:"replace",h:"Will AI replace testers?",p:["No, but the role is changing. AI handles repetitive work such as updating locators and drafting boilerplate tests.
